# Code & Conquer

## Project Overview
Code & Conquer is a turn-based strategy game that combines programming concepts with an engaging gameplay experience. Players control units by writing simple commands to navigate through a battlefield, defeat enemies, and reach objectives, making the game both fun and educational.

## Installation
To run Code & Conquer locally, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/code-conquer.git
cd code-conquer

```

Ensure that you have an internet connection as the game utilizes CDN links for CSS frameworks.

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on "Start Game" to begin your adventure.
3. Use the code editor to enter commands to control your unit (e.g., `move(2, 'right')`, `attack()`).
4. Drag commands from the button panel into the code editor for easier coding.
5. Click "Execute" to run your commands and see the results on the battlefield.
6. Follow objectives to win the game while managing enemy interactions.

## Features
- Interactive game board with draggable commands
